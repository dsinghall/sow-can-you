In an interview with Kheti Virasat Mission (KVM), he revealed that like everyone else, he had been using chemicals on his crops since 1968 up until 2002, when he decided to switch to organic farming. He switched because the pests meant to be eradicated by the chemicals were still harming his crops, and also because the harmful chemicals led to intestinal cancer in his mother. So, with the help of KVM, he transformed 2 of the 6 acres to grow all natural cotton, guar, vegetables, and fodder for the cows.</p><p> At the beginning of his farming life he found the dangers of chemicals to be much more revolutionary than their yields. He revealed that yields increased from 32 quintals to 40. He tried different farming methods with his brother however, their sharecropper did not want to let go of the “increased yield”.</p><p> Now, after 21 years of farming naturally, he reflects that the input is very minimal and he is earning the same amount of money as he did while he was using chemical fertilizers. The biggest challenge he says is finding labor. It is difficult to find labor willing to work with cow dung. At the beginning of his transition he was constantly criticized by other villagers, however, now that their yields are decreasing and inputs are increasing, they are actively reaching out to him to also go all natural.</p>";

To make Sikkim an organic state, the state’s government promoted the idea of organic instead of chemicals and made it against the law to use chemical fertilizers, pesticides, etc. Additionally, they established a punishment of imprisonment and fine if the law was to be violated. It took the state 13 long and difficult years to convert itself to all organic, however, once they did in 2016, they noticed an increase in more than 22 lakh hectares of production. In addition to its agricultural benefits, the state has seen significant improvements in its water quality as well as tourism. The population of Sikkim now no longer fears the detrimental effects of agrichemicals and experiences a boost in its economy through the alleviated tourism. The state has been recognized and awarded for its hard work by many international organizations and countries including the United States, and the members of the United Nations (UN).</p>";

Janardan alleviated the farm's worth from 10 lakh to 4 crore rupees and is currently retired at the age of 32. Throughout his ownership of the brand, Janardan created many award winning organic products which earned him the name Saladbaba. He looks back and enjoys the time he used to farm. He says in an interview for The Indian News Express “Very often I saw people complain about how organic food is expensive, but it's not true. When you have your farm, it's not expensive. I never bought vegetables my entire life because they were free; from my farm. If you know how to make compost, then it becomes so affordable.”</p>";

They avoid using chemical fertilizers and herbicides and instead use methods like multi cropping and intercropping to keep harmful pests away and promote healthy soil composition.

In six years they transformed an empty piece of land into a mixture of commercial and experimental farming. They currently grow organic fruits, vegetables, and other miscellaneous crops.</p>";
